"Logistic Regression model evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix visualization
# Model Evaluation with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to evaluate a classification model using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix (counts & normalized)
- Classification Report

## Dataset
- Uses `sklearn`'s built-in Breast Cancer dataset.

## Steps
1. Train/Test split
2. Train Logistic Regression model
3. Make predictions
4. Calculate evaluation metrics
5. Visualize confusion matrix

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python evaluation.py
